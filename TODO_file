%%%-#define for first interrupt task i.e. INTERRUPT_TASK()
%%%-Interrupt task should call custom function prologue that saves
%%%  int flag
%%%-Add return from interrupt function
%%%-TRANSITION_TO checks for the interrupt flag set in curctx, sets int flag in
%%%    next task if set in current task
%%%-IRET: like transition_to, but unsets interrupt flag in next task
%%%-ISSUE: Transition_to picks next task up in threads[] - probably shouldn't  if
%%%        inside interrupt handler
%%%-Shouldn't need to store interrupt task information in threads[], current should
%%% stay the same (so that upon IRET, we return to the same location)
%%%    (although, certianly easier to do so)
%%%-Scheduler_task modifications - by default it'll schedule the thread after
%%% the one that was running after an IRET transition


-actually enable interrupts for a msp430 device (timer?)
-write app_blinker chain to run one task on interrupt
