List of TODO's for Milestone 0: 

-Define Scheduler "reach"
	What exactly will the scheduler task be responsible for?
	
-Nail down exactly what is defined at compile time
	So far, programmer specifies which sequences of tasks can be run concurrently and the
	maximum number of concurrent instances, so channels can be statically allocated at
	compile time.

-Easy follow up to last TODO is to write a script that handles the channel definitions, or use REPEAT macro

-Add thread number field to context variable so tasks know which channels to read
 from/write to.

-Add scheduler task and show that multicast In functionality works, then hand control to
 the transitionTo() argument task as per usual. 

Long term TODO's:

-Figure out synchronization primitives
-Make tasks deschedule themselves from scheduler queue
-Get tasks to wait until "feeder" tasks have provided reasonable output.
